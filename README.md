Name: Kanvas
- A DB-backed website using Python with Flask framework, Jinja, HTML and minimal CSS.
- Inspired by an already existing website, Canvas
- Used my institutions to keep track of students and lecturers/teachers

Running the Website:
- Download all the files
- Find and open the index.html
- Run it on a server (i.e VSCode with Live Server)
- You can use the sample accounts for lecturers and students to use it
- Or can use the admin account to create your own accounts (admins log into the lecturer accounts)

Features:
- Lecturers:
  - Grading student uploads
  - Uploading files for students to download
  - Adding annoucements
  - Grading submissions and adjusting grades
  - Filter system for finding specific students
- Students:
  - Downloading assignments uploaded by lecturers
  - Uploading completed assignments
  - View of all due assignments and their status
  - View of all announcements posted with a filter system
  - Viewing grades
- Admins:
  - Adding new students/lecturers to the database
    - Involving creating a Kanvas account for them and adding them to their respective modules
  - Creating other admin accounts
  - Deleting users
 
Thank you for trying out my project!
